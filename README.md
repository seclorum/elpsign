# elpsign
Embrace Literal Plasticity - a sign generator

This is an OpenSCAD script which can be used to generate a "traffic sign" 
containing any text you want to include, as well as an icon and sub-text.

Use OpenSCAD to open this, change the text and symbol according to your
needs, and then render.

Note: may require some tweaking to get the fonts correct.
